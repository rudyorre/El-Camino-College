# CS 30 - Advanced Programming in C++
CS 30 is Advanced Programming in C++, which I took under Professor Solomon Russell in the Spring of 2020. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to document and showcase my work.

This course presents an advanced coverage of the C++ programming language. Topics presented include templates, the Standard Template Library, data abstraction, operator overloading, inheritance, friend functions, virtual functions, multiple inheritance, and virtual base classes. An emphasis will be placed on object-oriented programming.
