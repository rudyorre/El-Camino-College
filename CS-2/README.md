# CS 2 - Introduction to Data Structures
CS 2 is Introduction to Data Structures (in C++), which I took under Professor Yih-Yu Hwang in the Fall of 2019. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to document and showcase my work.

In this course, the C++ computer language is used to demonstrate methods of representing and manipulating data structures. The student will learn the object-oriented problem solving skills necessary to read, write, and correct complex computer programs, and to make important design decisions. Topics include lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching, sorting, modeling and algorithm analysis.
