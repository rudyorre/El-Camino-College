# CS 8 - Foundations of Data Science
CS 8 is Foundations of Data Science (in Python), which I took under Professor Solomon Russell, Professor Alice Martinez, and Professor Jin Chon in the Spring of 2021. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to document and showcase my work.
