    "<h3>Answer</h3>\n",
    "Although at first glance the data might seem to support the claim that burglars are more likely to burglarize during Memorial Day and Labor Day, looking a little deeper contradicts this claim. If we take the number of days between Memorial Day (May 31st) and Labor Day (Septemeber 6th) in 2020, we find that there are 98 days. If we take 98 and divide it by the number of days in a year, we get:  \n",
    "<h3><center>$\\frac{98 \\text{ days}}{365 \\text{ days}}=26.8\\% \\text{ of the year}$</center></h3>  \n",
    "This means that according to the statistic provided by ADT Security, over 25% of home burglaries a year occur during a time period that makes up over 25% of the year (26.8%). There is no proportional increase of home burglaries during this period, therefore making the statistic useless and the claim  has no basis. In fact, it could be argued that less burglaries occur during this time period, since it makes up  27% of the year and contains \"over\" 25% of the home burglaries."

    "In lecture, we counted the number of times that the literary characters were named in each chapter of the classic book, [Little Women](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/3/1/literary-characters). In computer science, the word \"character\" also refers to a letter, digit, space, or punctuation mark; any single element of a text. The following code generates a scatter plot in which each dot corresponds to a chapter of Little Women. The horizontal position of a dot measures the number of periods in the chapter. The vertical position measures the total number of characters."
