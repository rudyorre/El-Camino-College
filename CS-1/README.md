# CS 1 - Problem Solving and Program Design
CS 1 is Problem Solving and Program Design (in C++), which I took under Professor Satish Singhal in the Summer of 2019. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to document and showcase my work.

This course is an introduction to problem solving and program design using structured, top-down, algorithmic development techniques applied to the solution of numeric and non-numeric problems. Software engineering topics such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, documentation, and maintenance of software are discussed. Laboratory work will be done using the C++ computer language. The course also summarizes the evolution of programming languages illustrating how this history has led to the paradigms available today.
