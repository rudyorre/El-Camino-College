# CS 14 - Computer Programming in Python
CS 14 is Computer Programming in Python, which I took under Professor Massoud Ghyam in the Spring of 2021. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to document and showcase my work.

This course is an introduction to computer programming and algorithm design using Python programming language for computer science. The course covers the fundamentals of Python programming: basic data types, objects, switching and looping constructs, functions, recursion, objects, arrays, and lists, and basic input and output, both interactive and with files.
