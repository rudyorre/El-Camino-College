# CS 14 - Computer Programming in Python
CS 14 is Computer Programming in Python, which I took under Professor Massoud Ghyam in the Spring of 2021. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to document and showcase my work.

Since this was a very introductory course, I spent the extra time I had from this course to work on my own Python projects, which I have posted here.
